## 📘 Overview

The **Intelligent Contextual Legal Verification System (ICLVS)** is a Legal-Tech demonstrative framework designed to automate and standardize the verification of legal documents across multiple jurisdictions.

By integrating **AI-driven contextual reasoning** with **normative adaptation and audit traceability**, the system supports legal transparency, compliance efficiency, and cross-border regulatory trust.
