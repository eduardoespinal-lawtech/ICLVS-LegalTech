## 🧠 About

I am a legal researcher and system architect specialized in **AI-driven regulatory compliance** and **contextual legal automation**.  
My work focuses on designing frameworks that merge **normative reasoning**, **algorithmic traceability**, and **cross-jurisdictional clause adaptation** within intelligent verification systems.

The ongoing project — **Intelligent Contextual Legal Verification System (ICLVS)** — demonstrates how artificial intelligence can interpret, evaluate, and adapt contractual clauses according to jurisdictional and regulatory contexts.  
It provides a *functional and auditable model* for real-time compliance validation, document transparency, and machine-assisted legal consistency.

## 🎯 Project Vision

> “To transform legal verification into a transparent, adaptive, and computationally auditable process.”

ICLVS aligns with global principles of **Responsible AI**, **RegTech**, and **Digital Governance**, proposing a hybrid model where human legal expertise and algorithmic logic collaborate to ensure:
- Normative consistency across jurisdictions  
- Accelerated compliance review cycles  
- Automated detection of conflicts of law  
- Quantifiable traceability of legal decisions

## ⚙️ Technical Scope

| Component | Function | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Ingestion Layer** | Input parsing | Processes legal text and metadata |
| **Contextual Reasoning Engine** | AI inference | Detects applicable jurisdiction and clause semantics |
| **Normative Adaptation Module** | Rule alignment | Adjusts legal clauses to target regulatory frameworks |
| **Traceability & Audit Layer** | Transparency | Generates SHA-256 hash logs and trace IDs for evidentiary use |
| **Metrics Visualization** | Evaluation | Displays performance indicators for compliance validation efficiency |

## 🧩 Demonstrative Prototype

The pilot web system (`pilot.html`) illustrates the operational workflow of ICLVS in a **browser-based simulation**.  
It performs:
- Clause analysis and keyword detection  
- Jurisdiction-based rule matching  
- Risk scoring (0–100) with traffic-light logic  
- Automatic clause adaptation  
- Cryptographic trace generation (SHA-256)  
- JSON export of verification logs  

> ⚖️ This simulation is **self-contained**, requires **no backend**, and is suitable for **evidentiary demonstration before USCIS** under the *EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW)* framework.
